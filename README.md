### Hexxagon
This repository contains the implementation of a strategic board game
called Hexxagon using Python and the pygame library. The game supports
multiple modes, including Human vs Human, AI vs AI, and Human vs AI, with
AI strategies implemented using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning algorithms.
The objective is to provide an engaging gameplay experience while
showcasing the implementation of advanced AI techniques.
## Objectives
1. Create a visually appealing hexagonal grid-based board game.
2. Implement various player types:
• Human players.
• AI players using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning.
• Random move generators.
3. Provide multiple gameplay modes:
• Human vs Human.
• Human vs AI (minimax).
• Human vs AI (alpha-beta).
• Human vs Random
• AI (minimax) vs AI (minimax).
• AI (minimax) vs AI (alpha-beta).
• AI (minimax) vs Random.
• AI (alpha-beta) vs AI (alpha-beta).
• AI (alpha-beta) vs Random.
• Random vs Random.
4. Ensure smooth interaction and user-friendly UI.
